Our Girls Troop is a group of youth leaders who come together and work together to plan campouts meetings work on requirements for ranks which include cooking, fire saftey, wood tools, leadership, friendship, and so much more. the adults are there to provide supervision the adults are there to help with saftey which makes scouts the perfect place to fail becasue it is safe and they will learn and become a more capable leader. This troop meets at [Community Bible Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Community+Bible+Church/@29.6083609,-98.4551142,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x865c61f893143835:0x6a9757940e4df853!8m2!3d29.6083609!4d-98.4529255) on the first floor to your immediate right.
