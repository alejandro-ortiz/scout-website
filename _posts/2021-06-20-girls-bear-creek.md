Our Bear Creek Camping trip <br><br>
The Girls had a really good time at bear creek! They got to do all sorts of fun things like COPE, archery, handicrafts, ecology, and the rangers had lots of fun doing a little bit of everything. One of the best parts of camp is seeing all the firsts years and the patrols learn more about eachother over the week and work together better. I think that everyone in the troop learned a few good lessons and is exited for next campout.
