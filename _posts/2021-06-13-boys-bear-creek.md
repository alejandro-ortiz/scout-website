Our Bear Creek Camping trip <br><br>
The boys had a really good time at bear creek! They got to do all sorts of fun things like archery, riffle, and the first years did the ranger program which was a little bit of everything so everybody had lots to do. One of the best parts of camp is seeing all the firsts years and the patrols learn more about eachother over the week and work together better. I think that everyone in the troop learned a few good lessons and is exited for next campout.
