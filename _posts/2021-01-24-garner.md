Our Garner Camping Trip<br> <br>
We had a great place at garner with loads of open space and lots of picnic tables for all the scouts to eat on. Some had to put their patrol box/chuck box on the picnic bench but 2 patrols had patrol boxes that stood on their own! All patrols have these amazing boxes which contain stoves, pots, pans, small fuel containers, duct tape, lanterns, spices, and so much more! we can't wait to have your scouts at our campout where them and their patrol can practice their cooking skills.
