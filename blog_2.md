Our Garner State Park Camping Trip! <br><br>
We had a great place at garner with loads of open space and lots of picnic tables for you scouts to eat on. Some had to put their patrol box/chuck box on the picnic bencha as well but 2 patrols had patrol boxes that stood on their own! All patrols have these amazing boxes which contain stoves, pots, pans, small fuel containers, duct tape, lanterns, spices, and so much more! we can't wait to have you at our campout where you and your patrol can practice your cooking skills.
