    <h2>Scouting</h2>

    <p>You may recognize scouts for "being prepared" or outdoorsy, but there is much more to it than that. The
        mission of scouting is to preparing youth for life! To prepare scouts to make good choices, the scouting
        program focuses on character development, leadership development, citizenship training, and personal
        fitness. Our scouting units are blessed to be part of Community Bible Church... so preparing youth for
        life definitely includes their eternal life! Scouting provides a great opportunity to practice and
        discuss our duty to God.</p>
