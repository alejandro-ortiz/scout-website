Welcome to Troop 226 we meet at meets at [CBC] in San Antonio, Texas. We welcome
new scouts, boys, and girls to our Troop where we have meetings on Mondays from
7:00-8:00 at CBC. Our patrols work together and talk about what activities they
want to do and their patrol leaders talk to adults and other scouts to help
organize those events. Find out more about our Troop by contacting
