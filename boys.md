Our boys Troop is a group of youth leaders who come together and work together to plan campouts meetings work on requirements for ranks which include cooking, fire saftey, wood tools, leadership, friendship, and so much more. Adults are there to provide supervision and to help with safety, which makes scouts the perfect place to learn and become a more capable leader. This troop meets at [Community Bible Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Community+Bible+Church/@29.6083609,-98.4551142,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x865c61f893143835:0x6a9757940e4df853!8m2!3d29.6083609!4d-98.4529255) on the 3rd floor to your left. CBC is also a great church if any of you are looking for a church! We would love for you to join us at our next meeting or one of our campouts which happen once a month.
