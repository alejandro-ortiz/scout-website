 You found the boys troop page! I don't know if you've heard about the scout program but if you haven't then scouts is a group of young leaders who come together and work together to plan campouts meetings work on requirements for rankswhich include cooking, fire saftey, wood tools, leadership, friendship, and so much more. Mainly the adults are there to provide supervision the adults are there to help with saftey which makes scouts the perfect place to fail! You may not seem exited by this but when scouts fail they always learn from it and do better next time which is amazing. This troop meets at [Community Bible Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Community+Bible+Church/@29.6083609,-98.4551142,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x865c61f893143835:0x6a9757940e4df853!8m2!3d29.6083609!4d-98.4529255) one the 3rd floor to your left Which is also a great church if any of you are intrested! We would love for you to join us in our next meeting or one of our campouts which happen once a month

#### Campout at Garner
One of our recent adventures Camping at Garner state park! We had a blast on this one. We got to go for a hike than go to the OA callout ceremony while using our blacklights which were very fun to use! Our patrols used their chuckboxes cooking supplies.
