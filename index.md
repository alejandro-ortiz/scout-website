Our Scouts BSA program which is for Middle School and High School youth consists of two units – one for boys and another for girls. These groups prepare today’s young people to make good choices by focusing on character and leadership development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. We are looking forward to a fun year of Scouting! With Troop 226 boys, girls, or pack 226

> Proverbs 2:26 Train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it.

#### Campout at McGimsey
We had a great campout at McGimsey and had lots of fun cooking, setting up tents, and teaching the new patrol how to make fires and use wood tools. We hope to see you on our next campout and if you want to learn more about our fun time click [here](blog_1.html)
